*The set up for what follows is fueled by a frustration at my own feelings, perspectives, and attitudes. How they project and materialise in my environment as the life I live does not seem to add up correctly. I always find myself exploring why this is the case and absorbing information that explores this in one way or another.*

*This post will be a thought train based off a quote on happiness. It is simply an exercise of exploration, and is most definitely not the whole story.*

Elon musk recently said in an [interview with Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycPr5-27vSI):
> <h2>Happiness = Reality - Expectations<h2>

It's such a simple statement that feels as if it holds some truth, although, I wonder if replacing the term happiness with success, would also hold true. Anyway I think this is an interesting statement and, under the assumption that it is a truth, it would be interesting to objectively explore what it might mean, or see what I can take from it.

Let's grab a definition for happy in English, as from this context it could mean a lot of things.

The Oxford Dictionary (OD) [defines happy](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/happy) as:
> **happy** 
1. Feeling or showing pleasure or contentment.
‘Melissa came in looking happy and excited
*[with clause]* ‘we're just happy that he's still alive’
*[with infinitive]* ‘they are happy to see me doing well’
    1. (happy about) Having a sense of trust and confidence in (a person, arrangement, or situation)
    ‘he was not happy about the proposals’
	2. (happy with) Satisfied with the quality or standard of.
	‘I'm happy with his performance'
	3. *[with infinitive]* Willing to do something.
	‘we will be happy to advise you’
	4. *[attributive]* Used in greetings.
	‘happy Christmas’
2. *[attributive]* Fortunate and convenient.
‘he had the happy knack of making people like him’
3. *informal [in combination]* Inclined to use a specified thing excessively or at random.
‘they tended to be grenade-happy’

So happiness seems to be about feeling/showing pleasure, contentment, having trust, confidence, being satisfied, willing, fortunate, and throwing grenades.

Lets explore the "happiness equation" and some of the consequences of it. 

No one is happy all of the time, I think I can safely say that with no reference, as it seems to be a rule of life. If it is assumed that the **Happiness** term fluctuates between a positive (happy) value and a negative (sad) value, and that is a representation of the human state of mind, then it must be caused by the changing of either or both terms: **Expectations** and **Reality**. 

So what are expectations and reality?

The OD [defines expectations](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/expectation) as:
> **expectations** 
1. A strong belief that something will happen or be the case. *'reality had not lived up to expectations'*
	1. A belief that someone will or should achieve something. *'students had high expectations for their future'*.
	2. (expectations) *archaic* One's prospects of inheritance.
2. *Mathematics* another term for expected value

The OD [defines reality](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/reality) as:
> **reality** 
1. The state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them. *'he refuses to face reality'* *'Laura was losing touch with reality'*
	1. *\[count noun\]* A thing that is actually experienced or seen, especially when this is unpleasant. *'the harsh realities of life in a farming community'*
	2. *\[count noun\]* A thing that exists in fact, having previously only existed in one's mind. *'we want to make the dream a reality'*
	3. The quality of being lifelike. *'the reality of Marryat's detail'
	4. *\[as modifier\]* Relating to reality TV. *'a reality show'*
2. The state or quality of having existence or substance. *'youth, when death has no reality'
	1. *\[Philosophy\]* Existence that is absolute, self-sufficient, or objective, and not subjective to human decisions or conversations.

From the example in the first definition of expectations it seems these two terms are very much linked in the human psyche! 
Now when you pull this down to real life it is likely that **reality** is an ever changing term, fluctuating just like my attempt at eating healthily. *Some things in reality are just out of your control!* Let's assume that **expectations**, for the time being, are constant and fully within your control. The idea being that a person has formulated a very clear expectation of reality and sticks to it. Now the funny thing is that in my case I cannot concretely decide right now if my **expectations** term fluctuates, I suppose I have never asked the question, which may be an underlying part of the problem. Regardless, it stands to reason that at times there will be a **happiness** deficit, when the happiness term is negative, which you might call the the sadness in our life, occurring when the reality term is much lower than expectations. When observing a constantly changing reality term, if our expectations are constant, we might, if the reality term is oscillating in some way around the average value of expectations, experience the normal joys and sadness of life.

So what happens when the happiness equation is negative for long periods of time? In other words, what happens when the reality term is oscillating around an average value which is lower than the expectations term? It seems that under this model there is one possibility:

1. Average reality term is always lower than expectations, which leads to a happiness deficit.

Why, have I called it a "happiness deficit" and not "sadness". Simply because the next step after this is where there are different possibilities under the same state, in my opinion (hmm this may have become less objective):

1. [Sadness](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sad): Reality < Expectations, neither term changes
2. [Motivation](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/motivation): Reality < Expectations, neither term changes

How can state *1.sadness* and state *2.motivation* coexist under the same conditions?

**Perspective** (in my opinion)

You can look at a situation and take the position that it is unchangeable at that very moment in time or you can look at a situation and take the position that it is changeable at that very moment in time, this right here, appears to be a binary decision which is under our own control.

The OD [defines perspective](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/perspective) as:
> **perspective**
1. *[mass noun]* The art of representing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface so as to give the right impression of their height, width, depth, and position in relation to each other.
‘the theory and practice of perspective’
*[as modifier]* ‘a perspective drawing’
    1. The appearance of viewed objects with regard to their relative position, distance from the viewer, etc.
    ‘a trick of perspective’
	2. *[count noun]* A view or prospect.
	3. *Geometry* The relation of two figures in the same plane, such that pairs of corresponding points lie on concurrent lines, and corresponding lines meet in collinear points.
2. A particular attitude towards or way of regarding something; a point of view.
‘most guidebook history is written from the editor's perspective’
    1. *[mass noun]* True understanding of the relative importance of things; a sense of proportion.
    ‘we must keep a sense of perspective about what he's done’
    ‘though these figures shock, they need to be put into perspective’
3. An apparent spatial distribution in perceived sound.

So our perspective could be seen as being defined by an attitude we have.

The OD [defines attitude](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/attitude) as:
> **attitude** 
1. A settled way of thinking or feeling about something.
‘he was questioned on his attitude to South Africa’
‘being competitive is an attitude of mind’
	2. A position of the body indicating a particular mental state.
    ‘the boy was standing in an attitude of despair’
	3. *Ballet* A position in which one leg is lifted behind with the knee bent at right angles and turned out, and the corresponding arm is raised above the head, the other extended to the side.
2. *North American informal [mass noun]* Truculent or uncooperative behavior.
‘I asked the waiter for a clean fork and all I got was attitude’
    1. Individuality and self-confidence.
    ‘she snapped her fingers with attitude’
3. The orientation of an aircraft or spacecraft, relative to the direction of travel.

So we are kind of circling around the bottom of the barrel on these two definitions now. Attitude is based on a "way of thinking or feeling". This suggests that our attitudes in life are intrinsically linked to our patterns of thought and emotions. This makes a lot of sense, it seems very simple. So maybe if we want to take control of changing happiness (not necessarily becoming happy, but changing it), then we must have control over our ways of thinking and feelings, through a choice in the attitude we adopt, and the perspective we decide to use. The time factor is critical though, going back to what was mentioned about perspective, there is a fundamental choice that happens when a situation arises: You can decide a situation is totally unchangeable, you decide a situation is changeable but you won't, or convince yourself you can't change it right now maybe later, or, you decide it is changeable and make a decision to stop waiting around and change it right now. This last option is the hardest to do, there are no excuses to hide behind, no kidding ourself or BS, you decide to change something and you do it, I think this is the only decision that leads to motivation. I suppose one last thought on happiness is that it's clear it is never constant, it fluctuates, and that seems natural and healthy. When setting expectations it may not be wise to set them to being 100% happy, 100% of the time, because based on this idea at least, you're going to end up in a happiness deficit.

A [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/267482-the-longer-i-live-the-more-i-realize-the-impact) from Charles R. Swindoll:
>**"The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes."**

Finally, it is an interesting idea that our expectations of reality play a large part in how happy we may feel, I think this equation is not quite the right fit, I don't think anyone is looking for pure happiness, but we are certainly searching for something, and expectations of reality definitely plays a big part in it.

know why, if you didn't like it, let me know why!*

*It would also be interesting to explore some 
forks that were closed off, such as *"what if 
reality is constant and expectations 
fluctuate", "what happens if expectations 
slowly change with out you noticing"*, or 
*"if both reality and expectations 
fluctuate?"* would these change our resulting 
perceptions and attitudes, could there be 
some nasty feedback loops that are hampering 
a path out?*
